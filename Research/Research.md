"[Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance](/publications/AJLZ2021(4).pdf)" (Revised November 2021) \
(with Annette Alstadsaeter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman) \
Revise & Resubmit, *Journal of Public Economics*
  
<sub> Exploiting rich administrative data and salient policy variation, we study the substi-
tution between illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance. By increasing its enforcement
effort, the Norwegian government pushed many wealthy individuals to disclose assets pre-
viously hidden abroad. We find that the taxes paid by these individuals rise 30% at the
time of disclosure and that the rise is sustained over time. After stopping to evade, tax-
payers do not start avoiding more. Our results suggest that cracking down on evasion by
the wealthy can be an effective way to raise tax revenue, increase tax progressivity, and
ultimately reduce inequality. </sub>
