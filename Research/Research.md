"[Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4n7bnmqfckj1onj/AJLZ_JPubE.pdf?dl=0)" (with Annette Alstadsaeter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman), *Journal of Public Economics* (2022)
  
<sub> Exploiting rich administrative data and salient policy variation, we study the substitution between illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance. By increasing its enforcement effort, the Norwegian government pushed many wealthy individuals to disclose assets pre-
viously hidden abroad. We find that the taxes paid by these individuals rise 30% at the time of disclosure and that the rise is sustained over time. After stopping to evade, taxpayers do not start avoiding more. Our results suggest that cracking down on evasion by the wealthy can be an effective way to raise tax revenue, increase tax progressivity, and ultimately reduce inequality. </sub>

"[Wealth Taxation and Portfolio Allocation at the Top](https://segal-leguernherry.github.io/Research/)" (draft coming soon)

<sub> How does taxation affect portfolio choices at the top? I study this question using comprehensive administrative wealth and income tax returns for France. I leverage a 2017 reform which transformed the French wealth tax into a real estate tax –thus excluding financial wealth from the tax base. In a difference-in-differences setting, I study to what extend wealthy French taxpayers substitute (highly taxed) real estate for financial assets after the reform. My control group is composed of non-residents, who benefited from a full tax exemption on their financial investment located in France before the reform and thus who are not affected by the policy change. Intensive margin responses suggest a 5% reduction in taxable real estate after five years. Exploiting information on rental income, I show that most of this response is driven by adjustment in investment housing, as opposed to consumption housing. This study proposes for the first time to estimate the cross-elasticity between real estate and financial wealth, which I find to be strictly positive but rather modest. Overall, the results suggest that real estate and financial markets are relatively segmented, even at the top. </sub>

"[Avoiding Transparency through Offshore Real Estate: Evidence from the UK"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/axvw1fgudoeyvwg/BLGH_June2022_SciencesPoWP.pdf?dl=0) (with [Jeanne Bomare](https://sites.google.com/view/jeanne-bomare/about?authuser=0)) 

[*Young Researcher Award*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rSRteTuUw0), *European Union Tax Observatory*

<sub> This paper provides evidence of the growing importance of real estate assets in offshore portfolios. We study offshore real estate investment in the United Kingdom, using administrative data on direct and indirect ownership of properties. We establish two sets of results. First, we provide new evidence on the nature of the offshore real estate market in the UK. We show that this market is large and highly secretive: around 5% of total UK real estate wealth was held from abroad in 2018, mostly through tax havens. Matching transactions to leaked data and to administrative corporate registries, we find that most offshore investments can actually be traced back to owners from the UK and from the Middle East. Second, we investigate the drivers behind offshore real estate investment. We study the implementation of the first multilateral automatic exchange of information norm, the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which introduces cross-border reporting requirements for financial assets but not for real estate assets. We show that the implementation of the CRS led to a significant increase in real estate investment from companies incorporated in the tax havens that were the most exposed to the policy. We estimate that around $45 billion have been invested in the UK real estate market between 2013 and 2016 in reaction to the CRS. This suggests that at a global scale, a substantial portion of financial assets which fled tax havens after the CRS were ultimately re-invested in properties.   </sub>
