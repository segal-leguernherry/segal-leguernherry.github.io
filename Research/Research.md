"[Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance](/publications/1-s2.0-S0047272721002231-main.pdf)" (with Annette Alstadsaeter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman) 

Forthcoming, *Journal of Public Economics*
  
  
<sub> Exploiting rich administrative data and salient policy variation, we study the substitution between illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance. By increasing its enforcement effort, the Norwegian government pushed many wealthy individuals to disclose assets pre-
viously hidden abroad. We find that the taxes paid by these individuals rise 30% at the time of disclosure and that the rise is sustained over time. After stopping to evade, taxpayers do not start avoiding more. Our results suggest that cracking down on evasion by the wealthy can be an effective way to raise tax revenue, increase tax progressivity, and ultimately reduce inequality. </sub>

"Automatic Exchange of Information and Real Estate Investment" (with Jeanne Bomare) 
  
Working paper coming soon!

<sub> Building on rich administrative data on real estate purchases made by foreign companies in England and Wales, we identify one important channel through which tax evaders escape automatic exchange of information treaties: real estate investments, which are excluded from the scope of these agreements. First,
using several tax-related data leaks, we identify the country of residence of more than 2,500 company owners who appear in our database. We show that -among the identified investors - the residents from countries committing to the CRS in May 2014 reacted strongly to this event by investing in real estate in England and Wales. Second, exploiting heterogeneity in the choice of tax havens by country of residence, we extend this finding to all foreign companies in our database and document a significant increase in real estate investment between 2014 and 2016 because of the threat Automatic Exchange of Information constitutes for tax evaders. </sub>

I contributed to a report of the Cour des comptes on tax fraud in France called "La fraude aux prélèvements obligatoire", available [here]("https://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/publications/la-fraude-aux-prelevements-obligatoires") (in French) and published in December 2019.
