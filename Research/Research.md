"[Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4n7bnmqfckj1onj/AJLZ_JPubE.pdf?dl=0)" (with Annette Alstadsaeter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman), *Journal of Public Economics* (2022)
  
<sub> Exploiting rich administrative data and salient policy variation, we study the substitution between illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance. By increasing its enforcement effort, the Norwegian government pushed many wealthy individuals to disclose assets pre-
viously hidden abroad. We find that the taxes paid by these individuals rise 30% at the time of disclosure and that the rise is sustained over time. After stopping to evade, taxpayers do not start avoiding more. Our results suggest that cracking down on evasion by the wealthy can be an effective way to raise tax revenue, increase tax progressivity, and ultimately reduce inequality. </sub>

"[Wealth Taxation and Portfolio Allocation at the Top](https://segal-leguernherry.github.io/Research/)" (draft coming soon)

<sub> How does taxation affect portfolio choices at the top?  Leveraging a 2017 reform which transformed the French wealth tax into a real estate tax, I estimate the substitution between real estate and financial wealth once tax rates start to differ for both asset classes. To identify causal effects, I use comprehensive tax returns for France and a difference-in-differences design comparing French taxpayers to non-residents subject to the wealth tax but not affected by the policy change. Five years after the reform, the stock of real estate held by French taxpayers decreased by an average of 4%, with responses driven by investment rather than owner-occupied housing. Less than 10% of taxpayers can account for 100% of the observed decrease in real estate, revealing a strong heterogeneity between a minority of tax planners and a majority of households not responding at all. The decrease in real estate held by tax planners is mirrored by a surge in financial capital income received after the reform, consistent with asset shifting responses to the differential tax change.  Interpreted through the lens of a stylized model, my estimates imply a cross-elasticity of 5 between real estate and financial wealth, meaning that a 1 percentage point increase in the wealth tax differential between both asset classes imply a 5% shift from real estate to financial wealth. </sub>

<p><small>Previous title: "Will We Ever Be Able to Track Offshore Wealth? Evidence from the Offshore Real Estate Market in the UK"</small></p>


<sub> This paper provides evidence of the growing importance of real estate assets in offshore portfolios. We study offshore real estate investment in the United Kingdom, using administrative data on direct and indirect ownership of properties. We establish two sets of results. First, we provide new evidence on the nature of the offshore real estate market in the UK. We show that this market is large and highly secretive: around 5% of total UK real estate wealth was held from abroad in 2018, mostly through tax havens. Matching transactions to leaked data and to administrative corporate registries, we find that most offshore investments can actually be traced back to owners from the UK and from the Middle East. Second, we investigate the drivers behind offshore real estate investment. We study the implementation of the first multilateral automatic exchange of information norm, the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which introduces cross-border reporting requirements for financial assets but not for real estate assets. We show that the implementation of the CRS led to a significant increase in real estate investment from companies incorporated in the tax havens that were the most exposed to the policy. We estimate that around $45 billion have been invested in the UK real estate market between 2013 and 2016 in reaction to the CRS. This suggests that at a global scale, a substantial portion of financial assets which fled tax havens after the CRS were ultimately re-invested in properties.   </sub>
