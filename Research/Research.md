"[Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4n7bnmqfckj1onj/AJLZ_JPubE.pdf?dl=0)" (with Annette Alstadsaeter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman), *Journal of Public Economics* (2022)
  
<sub> Exploiting rich administrative data and salient policy variation, we study the substitution between illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance. By increasing its enforcement effort, the Norwegian government pushed many wealthy individuals to disclose assets pre-
viously hidden abroad. We find that the taxes paid by these individuals rise 30% at the time of disclosure and that the rise is sustained over time. After stopping to evade, taxpayers do not start avoiding more. Our results suggest that cracking down on evasion by the wealthy can be an effective way to raise tax revenue, increase tax progressivity, and ultimately reduce inequality. </sub>

"[Will We Ever Be Able to Track Offshore Wealth? Evidence from the Offshore Real Estate Market in the UK"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/axvw1fgudoeyvwg/BLGH_June2022_SciencesPoWP.pdf?dl=0) (with [Jeanne Bomare](https://sites.google.com/view/jeanne-bomare/about?authuser=0))

<sub> This paper provides evidence of the growing importance of real estate assets in offshore portfolios. We study the implementation of the first multilateral automatic exchange of information norm, the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which introduces cross-border reporting requirements for financial assets but not for real estate assets. Exploiting administrative data on property purchases made by foreign companies in the UK, we show that the implementation of the CRS led to a significant increase of real estate investments from companies incorporated in the tax havens that were the most exposed to the policy. We confirm that this increase comes from company owners of countries committing to the new standard by identifying the residence country of a sub-sample of buyers using the Panama Papers and other leaked datasets. We estimate that between £16 and £19 billion have been invested in the UK real estate market between 2013 and 2016 in reaction to the CRS, suggesting that at the global scale between 24% and 27% of the money that fled tax havens following this policy were ultimately invested in properties. </sub>

I contributed to a report of the Cour des comptes on tax fraud in France called "La fraude aux prélèvements obligatoire", available [here]("https://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/publications/la-fraude-aux-prelevements-obligatoires") (in French) and published in December 2019.
