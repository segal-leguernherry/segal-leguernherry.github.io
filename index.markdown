I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Sciences Po and work under the supervision of [Gabriel Zucman](https://gabriel-zucman.eu/) and [Jean Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/home?authuser=0). I was a Fulbright visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley from August 2022 to March 2023.

I am on the 2023/2024 Job Market 

My research investigates issues related to public economics, economics of taxation and applied microeconomics. I study in particular how households respond to taxes and the implications of these responses for tax progressivity and inequality. 

My Job Market Paper investigates the effect of wealth taxation on households portfolio structure, focusing particularly on the degree of substitution between real estate and financial assets.
