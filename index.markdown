I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Sciences Po. I work under the supervision of [Jean Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/home?authuser=0) and [Gabriel Zucman](https://gabriel-zucman.eu/). I will be visiting UC Berkeley in the Fall of 2022, sponsored by Fulbright.

My thesis, "*Essays on Behavioral Responses to Taxation*" investigates issues related to public economics, economics of taxation and applied microeconomics. I am particularly interested in tax evasion and its implications for tax progressivity and inequality.
