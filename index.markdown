I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Sciences Po and work under the supervision of [Gabriel Zucman](https://gabriel-zucman.eu/) and [Jean Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/home?authuser=0). I was a Fulbright visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley from August 2022 to March 2023.

I will be joining the Aix-Marseille School of Economics as Assistant Professor in September 2024.

In my research, I study how households respond to taxes and the implications of these responses for tax progressivity and inequality. My [Job Market Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/okxszehwtq2g1c9nhb8n2/JMP_LeGuernHerry.pdf?rlkey=5spuz7vbgv7g3s72kf3bwazfu&dl=0) investigates the effect of wealth taxation on households' portfolio structure, focusing particularly on the degree of substitution between real estate and financial assets.
